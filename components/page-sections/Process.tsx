          <p>After purchase you are invited to Discord, where you can connect with our team in real-time.</p>
          <p>We start shipping as soon as the requirements have been discussed and approved.</p>

            We exclusively build AI-powered apps and design systems on top of our own boilerplate. This means all the
            non-differentiating work has already been done and we can quickly build your features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Framework we use is Next.js (SSR) or Vue (SPA). Design systems are built with Sass UI, and Chakra UI or
            Panda CSS.
